                    Storing gases effectively requires porous materials with high surface areas. The highest surface area materials in the world are metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which is NuMat's area of expertise. To date, finding MOFs with the right pores has required significant amounts of trial-and-error, both in the labs where they are synthesized and at the whiteboards where they are designed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NuMat Technologies has developed novel computational algorithms that tremendously reduce the trial-and-error involved, allowing us to rapidly design the <em>right</em> MOF for the <em>right</em> application. These algorithms generate millions of hypothetical MOFs on a computer and simulate their gas storage abilities. From these simulations we are able to identify MOFs with the perfect pores in a matter of days, at which point we leverage our proprietary approach to synthesize materials of interest.
