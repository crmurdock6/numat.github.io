        Today in cool stuff happening in university labs: Northwestern researchers
        have created two new record-setting synthetic materials with the greatest
        internal surface areas ever seen. There are a lot of potential applications
        for these metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), named NU-109 and NU-110, but first
        the mind-bending fact: if you were to unfold a crystal of NU-110 the size
        of a grain of salt, the surface area would cover a desktop.

        "On America's roads, we're seeing a lot more big vehicles, like buses and
        trucks, that run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). So why don't we see any
        passenger cars run on the same fuel? Because natural gas needs to be
        extremely compressed in order for us to use it, we need HUGE gas tanks,
        and they are too big to fit into most cars. In other words, the tank needs
        to be shrunk. One company is working on doing just that. Instead of
        compressing gas, they discovered that more gas can be stored if there are
        more surfaces for the methane molecules to attach to. The researchers are
        working on developing a cyrstal-like material, called NuMat, that can be
        placed inside small tanks. They say that just a gram of the material has the
        same surface area as a football field! The company is still young, but they
        feel they are well on their way in their mission to move the Planet Forward.
        In fact, the U.S. Department of Energy agrees -- they awarded NuMat a
        $1.5 million grant!""

        "NuMat Technologies is commercializing a new class of nanomaterials that
        can store gases just like a sponge soaks up water. One of their nanomaterials
        would be for natural gas tanks used in everyday motor vehicles. This
        material can overcome the major hurdles impeding natural gas automobiles
        currently by: storing natural gas at a lower pressure making natural gas
        fuel tanks safer; enabling design flexibility such that the tanks can be
        designed around current automobile underpinnings, reducing production
        costs and shortening development time; and increasing driving range.
        Their technology would also enable the possibility of refueling natural
        gas vehicles at home."

        Not only are our materials high performing and tailorable, but they are
        also <i>predictable</i>. Knowing nothing more than the starting reagents,
        it is possible to construct the material, discern its characteristics,
