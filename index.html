      <h1>We are a materials-enabled gas technology company.</h1>
      <p>
        Our proprietary packaging and separation technology enables fundamental
        performance shifts in high-value consumer, commercial, and industrial
        products and systems.

      <h1>We are changing the way the world stores, separates, and transports gases.</h1>
      <p>
        Similar to a sponge soaking up water, our materials soak up gases at high
        concentrations. Simply put, a cylinder filled with one of our materials will
        store more gas than an empty vessel. This fundamental property grants us
        unparalleled design flexibility, enabling gas storage and transportation
        on container ships - forgoing costly cryogenic or high-pressure transport.

      <h1>We are a platform solution.</h1>
      <p>
        With millions of potential combinations, our materials can be custom tailored
        and optimized for applications. This is complemented by our high-throughput
        computational approach to material discovery, enabling us to exhaustively
        and accurately test materials without performing a single experiment.

      <h1>We have traction.</h1>
      <p>
        Our company is backed by an elite group of angel investors, and our
        technology has been lauded as a game changer for the gas storage,
        separation, and transportation industries. We've been especially proud of
        our ability to support research around moonshot ideas, looking into the
        future to address the true potential of our technology as a transformative
        next-generation platform.
