    Gases and the energy-intensive systems that create, deliver, and capture
    them are used in nearly every sector of the global economy.  We design and
    build systems that displace the need to highly compress gases. In doing so,
    we enable previously unachievable form factors and cost-advantaged
    economics in the energy, healthcare, and technology sectors.

    A universal property of gases is that they highly concentrate on surfaces.
    We take advantage of this property by creating materials with large amounts
    of internal surface area. One of our materials has the highest reported
    surface area to date; one gram of this material, when unfolded, would
    cover *over 1.5 football fields*. This surface area enables our materials
    to soak up gases like a bath sponge soaks up water, displacing the need for
    energy-intensive compression.

  description: |
    We design atomically engineered materials through the application of modern
    computing infrastructure to proprietary material discovery algorithms.
    Using our world-class discovery platform, we create millions of
    hypothetical structures, store these structures in databases, and then use
    high-performance cloud computing to rapidly simulate their properties. This
    capital-light approach allows us to dramatically reduce development cycles,
    rapidly generate IP, and support valuable application platforms with
    tailor-designed solutions.
