          We create products that take advantage of the scientific
          cutting edge. We do so by tailor-designing nanoporous materials -
          specifically metal-organic frameworks - for high-value applications which
          critically depend on material performance.

          While you may not notice them, sorbents are everywhere in todayâ€™s
          world.  Activated carbon is used to purify our air and water, and zeolites
          turn air into medical-grade gas. These sorbents all function by exploiting a
          fundamental physical property: gases like to stick to surfaces. By containing
          trillions of nano-sized pores, sorbents provide a lot of surface for gases.

          Sorbents are often categorized by their internal surface area, as more
          surface is correlated with higher performance. Our materials currently
          hold the surface area world record; in fact, a single gram of one of our
          materials would be able to cover 1.5 American football fields when
          unfolded. This means that gas molecules have significantly more contact
          area, drastically increasing the amount of adsorbed gas.

      description: |
          Metal-organic frameworks are not only higher performing than
          their competitors, but possess a unique property that simply cannot be
          emulated with current materials: atomically precise tunability. By adjusting the
          starting materials used, a near-infinite amount of metal-organic frameworks
          - all with unique and controllable properties - can be created.

          In contrast to non-crystalline materials such as activated carbon, this
          means that we are able to design materials that fully utilize their
          internal surface area. We control pore size and pore volume with
          sub-angstrom accuracy, and are able to covalently and uniformly bond
          functional motifs into the framework.

          In order to take full advantage of the combinatoric complexity of this
          class of materials, we use a suite of proprietary computational tools to
          quickly narrow down on top performers. Our computationally driven approach
          to material discovery allows us to quickly assess the performance of our
          materials in an application without performing a single experiment.

          Processes and products that use sorbents are fundamentally
          limited by the properties of the material. This limitation is always
          present, even though it manifests itself differently across
          applications.  Whether it means high-energy compression, impure offgas
          streams, low battery life, or logistical complexity, the ramifications
          of material limitations are felt across all gas-centric applications.

          Our engineering team starts with the best sorbents in the world. This
          provides unprecedented system-level design flexibility, allowing our
          solutions to perform better, last longer, save energy, and ultimately
          cost less.

          From portable oxygen generation to hazardous gas handling, our
          packaged products provide real value to real applications. We have a
          proven track record of delivering full-scale products into multiple
          high-value markets, and are continuing the creation of new prototypes
          while scaling validated solutions.
