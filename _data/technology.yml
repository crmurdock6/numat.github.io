    Gases and the energy-intensive systems that create, deliver, and
    capture them are used in nearly every sector of the global economy.
    We design and build systems that displace the need to highly compress
    gases. In doing so, we enable previously unachievable form factors
    and cost-advantaged economics in the energy, healthcare, and
    technology sectors.

    A universal property of gases is that they highly concentrate on
    surfaces. We leverage this property to create materials with vast
    internal surface areas. One of our materials is the world record holder
    with over 7,000 square meters of surface area per gram of material â€“
    the equivalent of 1.5 football fields when unfolded. Gases stick to the
    surfaces of our materials, creating a phenomenon where we soak up gases
    similar to how a bath sponge soaks up water - displacing the need for
    energy-intensive compression.

  description: |
    We design atomically engineered materials through the application of
    modern computing infrastructure to proprietary material discovery
    algorithms. Using our world-class discovery platform, we create
    millions of hypothetical structures, store these structures in
    databases, and then use high-performance cloud computing to rapidly
    simulate their properties. This capital-light approach allows us to
    dramatically reduce development cycles, rapidly generate IP, and
    support valuable application platforms where solutions are
    tailor-designed.
