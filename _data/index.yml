    Gases are a 500-billion-dollar input to nearly every sector of the global
    economy. However, storing, separating, and transporting gas requires
    energy intensive compression - accounting for nearly 10% of global energy
    draw.  Compression requirements significantly impact process economics and
    the ability to efficiently create life-sustaining gases and to effectively
    capture life-threatening ones.

    NuMat creates value by fundamentally challenging the need to compress
    gases. In doing so, we unlock massively valuable design flexibility and
    cost-advantaged production economics in the healthcare, industrial
    technology, and energy sectors.
