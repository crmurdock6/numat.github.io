    description: |
      Gases are a 500-billion-dollar input to nearly every sector of the global
      economy. However, storing, separating, and transporting gas requires
      energy intensive compression - accounting for nearly 10% of global energy
      draw.  Compression requirements impact our ability to efficiently create
      life-sustaining gases and effectively capture life-threatening toxins.

      NuMat creates value by fundamentally challenging the need to compress
      gases. In doing so, we unlock massively valuable design flexibility and
      cost-advantaged production economics in the healthcare, industrial
      technology, and energy sectors.
