  description: Gases are life-sustaining. They are also mission-critical inputs to
     nearly every sector of the global economy. However, producing and processing
     them is extremely energy intensive - significantly limiting product innovation
     and process economics. We provide a solution.

  description: Similar to a sponge soaking up water, our materials soak up gases
      at high concentrations. Simply put, a cylinder filled with one of our
      materials will store more gas than an empty vessel. This fundamental
      property grants us unparalleled design flexibility, enabling the creation
      of next-generation products for any application that uses gas.

  description: "Gas is everywhere: home health care, carbon sequestration,
      semiconductor manufacturing, purification, natural gas vehicles, and more.
      Our custom materials enable the creation of transformative solutions for
      all of these markets. We decrease compression costs, boost battery lives,
      unburden logistics, and improve safety across industries."

  description: Our company is backed by an elite group of angel investors, and
      our technology has been lauded as a game changer for the gas storage,
      separation, and transportation industries. We have been especially proud
      of our ability to support research around moonshot ideas, looking into the
      future to address the true potential of our technology as a transformative
      next-generation platform.
