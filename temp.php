					<h3>Breakthrough Technology: <br> Computational design & patented chemical processes.</h3>
					<p>
						To date, finding MOFs with the right pores has required significant amounts of trial-and-error, both in the labs where they are synthesized and at the whiteboards where they are designed. NuMat Technologies has developed novel computational algorithms tremendously reduce the trial-and-error involved, allowing us to rapidly design the right MOF for the right application. These algorithms generate millions of hypothetical MOFs on a computer and simulate their gas storage abilities. From these simulations we are able to identify MOFs with the perfect pores in a matter of days, at which point we begin planning the synthesis process.

					<h3>Markets: Many opportunities.</h3>
					<p>
						NuMat’s proprietary approach to material design and synthesis enables us to rapidly address needs in market segments that critically depend on material performance to unlock innovation.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>Natural Gas Markets</em><br>
						The natural gas boom has led to a fundamental reordering of the global energy economy. As the supply of affordable natural gas increases, so too does the need for natural gas storage, transportation and purification solutions. NuMat is actively developing high performing natural gas storage materials that will enable a paradigm shift in the design, performance and economics of gas storage solutions critical to the transportation sector. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>Industrial and Electronic Gas Storage Markets</em><br>
						High purity gases are mission critical inputs in industrial manufacturing and semiconductor industries. NuMat is actively developing materials to significantly increase the storage capacity and stability of high value gases in key application segments, enabling a compelling alternative to high compression and lower-performing adsorbent solutions. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>Separation, Filtration and Gas Purification Markets</em> <br>
						Whether through use of membranes, pressure swing adsorption or cryogenic distillation - the gas separation, filtration and purification markets are constantly striving for improved energy efficiency, increasing process yields, and improved process economics. NuMat is developing materials which significantly improve the performance and economics of process and filtration technologies in select applications of interest.
