## Job Description

As a chemist, you will drive the next generation of gas technology by
synthesizing materials and optimizing kinetics. As part of the close-knit NuMat
team, you will get the opportunity to collaborate across functional and
organizational lines, and will be working with all levels of individuals and
cultures as a leader, mentor, and follower.

## Roles and Responsibilities

 * Synthesis of MOFs and related organic ligands based on established procedures.
 * MOF characterization and kinetic studies using ICP-MS, NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopy.
 * Material formation and system-level testing.

## About You

* You have a B.S. or M.S. in chemistry or materials science.
* You have 1-2 years of industrial work experience, or an equivalent set of co-ops
  and internships.
* You know standard organic synthesis and characterization techniques, including
  column chromatography, recrystallization, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
  for <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C nuclei, inductively coupled plasma mass
  spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.
* You understand basic air-sensitive techniques, including the operation of
  gloveboxes and schlenk lines.
* You preferably have familiarity with reaction kinetics, mass transfer, coordination
  chemistry, and metal-mediated coupling reactions.
