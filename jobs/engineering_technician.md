## Job Description

As an engineering technician, you will work with the engineering team to build,
set up, and shake down new equipment. While working at a small yet growing
Company, you will be exposed to working with the entire technical team (R&D,
manufacturing, operations). Most projects will involve the build-out of
analytical lab equipment, proof-of-concept engineering systems, setup of pilot
chemical processes, and workflow optimization for the manufacture of NuMatâ€™s
innovative gas storage product technology.

## Roles and Responsibilities

 * Build test equipment to validate research materials in realistic proof-of-concept systems.
 * Set up of pilot-scale chemical unit operations (reactors, filters, dryers, columns, etc.).
 * Run experiments under engineering or research staff supervision.
 * Upgrade equipment as needed, and dismantle at end of life cycle.
 * Document setups, processes, and procedures.
 * Purchase equipment and components as required by the different projects.

## About You

 * You enjoy building things.
 * You are comfortable with standard workshop tools.
 * You are self-motivated, confident, and able to work in a fast-paced environment under some supervision.
 * You are used to managing multiple priorities.
 * You are familiar with pipe and tube fittings (NPT, compression, flange, etc.).
 * You are familiar with T-slotted framing, Unistrut, and DIN rail.
 * Preferably, you have experience with electrical and control wiring (to e.g. PLCs).
 * Preferably, you have a working knowledge of chemical process equipment.
 * Preferably, you have a working knowledge of adsorption systems (e.g. PSA).
