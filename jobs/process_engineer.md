## Job Description

As a scale-up engineer, you will focus on designing, building, optimizing, and
testing metal-organic framework (MOF) manufacturing processes. In addition, this
role will involve developing experimental equipment and running experiments to
demonstrate the performance of MOFs in separation and catalysis applications.
You will work with a high-energy and collaborative expert team of engineers and
scientists in a fast-paced environment.

## Roles and Responsibilities

 * Scale-up MOF synthesis and transition to high-volume manufacturing:
   - Evaluate and optimize existing MOF manufacturing processes using experimental work, theory, and modeling.
   - Design, construct, and install (with technician support) equipment used to validate scale-up initiatives.
   - Ability to work cross functionally (primarily with research and manufacturing groups).
   - Drive relations with manufacturing partners.
 * Demonstrate MOF performance for key separation and catalytic applications:
   - Predict performance via developing engineering models.
   - Design and build proof-of-concept systems.
   - Design and run experiments that validate the target application.
   - Analyze data and generate technical reports.

## About You

 * You are comfortable with mathematics, particularly reaction kinetics, adsorption, heat and mass transfer, thermodynamics, and numerical solvers.
 * You are comfortable with mechanical design and building your own laboratory equipment.
 * You have knowledge of pressure, temperature, vacuum, and flow equipment.
 * You have industrial experience and/or advanced studies involving catalysis or adsorption.
 * Your familiarity or expertise in electronics/control systems is preferred. Examples include:
   - Programming in UNIX, Python, Javascript, and preferably C.
   - Version control (git/github), database schema (relational, document, graph), web design, and digital communication (RS-232/485, TCP/IP, HTTP, TLS).
   - Breadboarding, PCB design, Arduino/Raspberry Pis, or equivalent.
   - PLCs, DCSs, and control communication standards.
