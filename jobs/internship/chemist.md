## Job Description

As a chemist, you will drive the next generation of gas technology by
synthesizing materials and optimizing kinetics. As part of the close-knit NuMat
team, you will get the opportunity to collaborate across functional and
organizational lines.

## Roles and Responsibilities

 * Synthesis of MOFs and related organic ligands based on established procedures.
 * MOF characterization and kinetic studies using ICP-MS, NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopy.
 * Reports directly to a Senior Chemist.

## About You

 * You have undergraduate experience in chemistry.
 * You know standard organic synthesis and characterization techniques, including
   column chromatography, recrystallization, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
   for <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C nuclei, inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.
 * You preferably have experience working with metal-organic frameworks.
