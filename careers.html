                    <p>We work with novel nano-materials, borrowing skillsets from chemistry, materials science, engineering, and computer science to do so. Above all, we expect people to be able to learn quickly and effectively on the job, working toward becoming an opinionated team player in a wide range of projects. That being said, there are skill sets we prefer to see.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Synthetic Chemist</h4>
                    <p>Our metal-organic frameworks often consist of organic ligands that are not readily available. Therefore, we value strong backgrounds in organic synthesis. Preferably, one would have experience working with crystalline materials and sorbents, understanding the techniques used in characterization in these fields.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Software Developer / Computational Theorist</h4>
                    <p>We use a variety of computational techniques to model the performance of our materials without needing to perform costly experiments. We commonly use C, Python, and Javascript, and we are avid supporters of modern scientific libraries such as IPython and PiCloud.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Chemical Engineer</h4>
                    <p>For every material created, we need to consider the benefits of economies of scale. Knowledge of transport, thermodyamics, kinetics, and controls required, experience with crystalline precipitation reactions a plus.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Business Development Specialist</h4>
                    <p>One of the largest tasks at NuMat is new market exploration. A fundamental understanding of the concepts underlying market forces and value propositions, as well as comfort in analytics and research, is required.</p>
