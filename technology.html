      <h2>Experiment meets theory.</h2>
      <p>NuMat Technologies is a materials technology company committed to
      enabling fundamental performance shifts in the gas storage and
      separations industries. We do so by tailor-designing nanoporous
      materials - specifically metal-organic frameworks - for high-value
      applications which critically depend on material performance.</p>
      <p>Compared to currently used sorbents - zeolites and activated
      carbon - metal-organic frameworks possess two game-changing properties:
      performance and tunability.</p>
      <p>In performance, their internal surface area is an order of magnitude
      larger than other options. The material shown to the right has a surface
      area greater than 6,000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and even better materials have
      been synthesized in our labs. This means that gas molecules have
      significantly more contact area with the sorbent, drastically increasing
      the amount of adsorbed gas.</p>
      <p>Metal-organic frameworks are not only higher performing than their
      competitors, but possess a unique property that simply cannot be emulated
      with either zeolites or activated carbon: atomically precise tunability.
      By adjusting the starting materials used, a near-infinite amount of
      metal-organic frameworks - all with unique and controllable
      properties - can be created.</p>
