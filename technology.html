      <h2>Materials-enabled product and system innovation.</h2>
      <p>
        NuMat Technologies is a materials technology company committed to
        enabling fundamental performance shifts in the gas storage and
        separations industries. We do so by tailor-designing nanoporous
        materials - specifically metal-organic frameworks - for high-value
        applications which critically depend on material performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to currently used sorbents - zeolites and activated
        carbon - metal-organic frameworks possess two game-changing properties:
        performance and tunability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The capabilities of our synthetic team are complemented by accurate
        high-throughput computational simulations, allowing us to test millions
        of materials without performing a single experiment.

      <h2>The highest performing materials in the world.</h2>
      <p>
        We create a class of materials with astronomical internal surface areas.
        A single gram of one of our world-record-shattering materials
        would be able to cover 1.5 American football fields when unfolded.
        This means that gas molecules have significantly more contact area with
        the sorbent, drastically increasing the amount of adsorbed gas.

      <h2>The perfect material for every application.</h2>
        <p>
          Metal-organic frameworks are not only higher performing than their
          competitors, but possess a unique property that simply cannot be emulated
          with either zeolites or activated carbon: atomically precise tunability.
          By adjusting the starting materials used, a near-infinite amount of
          metal-organic frameworks - all with unique and controllable
          properties - can be created.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to non-crystalline materials such as activated carbon,
          this means that we are able to design materials that fully utilize
          their internal surface area. We control pore size and pore volume with
          sub-angstrom accuracy, and are able to covalently and uniformly bond
          functional motifs into the framework.

      <h2>An elegant solution to material design.</h2>
        <p>
          Our materials are crystalline, meaning that they consist of
          highly predictable repeated unit cells. This enables us to predict the
          structure of materials in sub-second time, rather than spending resources
          synthesizing and characterizing every new material.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a structure has been determined, we use established practices to
          accurately determine the performance of the material in a given application.
          From beginning to end, the time between initial ideation and performance
          measurement takes approximately ten minutes. This is experimentation
          at the speed of thought, allowing us to rapidly prototype and test new
          ideas as quickly as we can dream them up.
