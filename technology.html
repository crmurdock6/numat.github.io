        At the heart of our products are a class of highly customizable
        materials. From this starting point, we build complete
        packaged solutions for industrial processes and consumer needs.

      <h2>The next generation of sorbents.</h2>
      <p>
        We create products that take advantage of the scientific cutting edge.
        We do so by tailor-designing nanoporous materials - specifically
        metal-organic frameworks - for high-value applications which
        critically depend on material performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you may not notice them, sorbents are everywhere in today's
        world. Activated carbon is used to purify our air and water, and
        zeolites turn air into medical-grade gas. These sorbents all function
        by exploiting a fundamental physical property: gases like to stick to
        surfaces. By containing trillions of nano-sized pores, sorbents provide
        a lot of surface for gases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorbents are often categorized by their internal surface area, as more
        surface is correlated with higher performance. Our materials currently
        hold the surface area world record; in fact, a single gram of one of
        our materials would be able to cover 1.5 American football fields when
        unfolded. This means that gas molecules have significantly more contact
        area, drastically increasing the amount of adsorbed gas.

      <h2>An elegant solution to material design.</h2>
      <p>
        Metal-organic frameworks are not only higher performing than their
        competitors, but possess a unique property that simply cannot be emulated
        with current materials: atomically precise tunability. By adjusting
        the starting materials used, a near-infinite amount of
        metal-organic frameworks - all with unique and controllable
        properties - can be created.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast to non-crystalline materials such as activated carbon,
        this means that we are able to design materials that fully utilize
        their internal surface area. We control pore size and pore volume with
        sub-angstrom accuracy, and are able to covalently and uniformly bond
        functional motifs into the framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to take full advantage of the combinatoric complexity of this
        class of materials, we use a suite of proprietary computational tools
        to quickly narrow down on top performers. Our computationally driven
        approach to material discovery allows us to quickly assess the
        performance of our materials in an application without performing a
        single experiment.

      <h2>Safer, cleaner, cheaper, better systems.</h2>
      <p>
        Processes and products that use sorbents are fundamentally limited
        by the properties of the material. This limitation is always present,
        even though it manifests itself differently across applications.
        Whether it means high-energy compression, impure offgas streams,
        low battery life, or logistical complexity, the ramifications of
        material limitations are felt across all gas-centric applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our engineering team starts with the best sorbents in the world. This
        provides unprecedented system-level design flexibility, allowing our
        solutions to perform better, last longer, save energy, and ultimately
        cost less.
      </p>
      <p>
        From portable oxygen generation to hazardous gas handling, our packaged
        products provide real value to real applications. We have a proven track
        record of delivering full-scale products into multiple high-value
        markets, and are continuing the creation of new prototypes while scaling
        validated solutions.
